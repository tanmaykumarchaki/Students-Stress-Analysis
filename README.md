#  Students-Stress-Analysis

##  Summary  
This project explores how stress and mental health impact students' academic and daily life habits. Using SQL, we analyze key aspects such as **study hours**, **sleep duration**, and **social media usage** among students aged 18 to 25.

The analysis aims to uncover patterns that can help educational institutions and counselors better understand student behavior and provide timely support.
